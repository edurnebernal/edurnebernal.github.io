<p style="text-align: justify"> I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://graphics.unizar.es/">Graphics and Imaging Lab</a> (Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://webdiis.unizar.es/~bmasia/">Belen Masia</a> and Prof. <a href="https://ana-serrano.github.io/">Ana Serrano</a>. Previously, I obtained my Batchelor’s degree in Electronic and Automatic Engineering and my Master’s degree in Robotics, Graphics, and Computer Vision, both at Universidad of Zaragoza. My main research interests include virtual reality, applied perception, and deep learning, but I am always open to new interesting lines of research.

<p style="text-align: justify"> My PhD thesis focuses on modeling human perception in virtual reality environments, and how it can be used to improve virtual reality content generation and visualization.
